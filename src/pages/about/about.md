I'm a software engineer, backed by an ideology to build highly performant and scalable products. 
Quickly fathoming a problem and progressively finding its solution have been the building blocks of my professional career.
Currently, playing with code at ixigo ("ik-si-go") on PWA applications for different customer facing verticals, 
making it light weight and accessible.
